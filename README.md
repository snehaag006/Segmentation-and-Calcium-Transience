# Segmentation-and-Calcium-Transience

This Python-based project provides an automated solution for analyzing fluorescence microscopy data. It enables **segmentation** of biological structures (such as cells or nuclei) and the calculation of **mean fluorescence intensity** within each segmented region. The tool is designed for ease of use with a **Tkinter GUI**, allowing users to select files, process them, and visualize the results.


### üìä Features

- **Segmentation**: Automatically segments biological structures using intensity thresholding and region labeling techniques.
- **Mean Fluorescence Calculation**: Computes the mean fluorescence intensity for each segmented region.
- **Batch Processing**: Supports processing of multiple `.csv` files, making it suitable for high-throughput experiments.
- **GUI Interface**: A simple and interactive graphical user interface for file selection and displaying results.
- **Output**: Results are saved as Excel files for easy sharing and further analysis.


### ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/segmentation-mean-fluorescence.git
2. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the script via the terminal or use the GUI interface:
   ```bash
   python segmentation_mean_fluorescence.py


üß∞ Technologies Used:

  ‚Ä¢	Python for scripting and image analysis
  ‚Ä¢	NumPy, Pandas for data manipulation and analysis
	‚Ä¢	OpenCV for image processing tasks (if applicable)
	‚Ä¢	Tkinter for building the graphical user interface
	‚Ä¢	Matplotlib for data visualization (optional)


üéØ Use Case

This tool is particularly useful for researchers in fields like cell biology, microbiology, and bioimaging who need to quantify fluorescence intensities from microscopy images. It is ideal for experiments measuring protein expression or cell activity using fluorescence markers.


üìà Example Workflow
	1.	Input: Import fluorescence microscopy data saved in .csv format (e.g., exported from Fiji/ImageJ).
	2.	Segmentation: The tool segments the regions of interest based on intensity thresholds.
	3.	Quantification: It calculates the mean fluorescence intensity for each segmented region.
	4.	Output: Results are saved to an Excel file, including the segmented regions and their corresponding fluorescence intensities.
